This is a group project for The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin.

Project Overview: The site is essentially an airBnB, but for garage spaces.  So, for example, if someone moves to a new city and they need a place to store their motorcycle, boat, or any other item, they can go to this site, find someone who has extra garage space (or shed space, or whatnot), and pay to use it for a certain amount of time.
